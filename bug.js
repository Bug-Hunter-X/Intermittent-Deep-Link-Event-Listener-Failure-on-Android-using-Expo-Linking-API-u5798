This bug occurs when using the Expo `Linking` API to handle deep links on Android.  After the app is opened from a deep link, subsequent attempts to open the same deep link result in the `Linking.addEventListener` listener not firing.  This doesn't happen consistently, and sometimes works correctly, making debugging challenging. It appears linked to the order of events and internal handling within Expo's Linking implementation.
